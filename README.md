# CRM Dashboard – Frontend Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates my approach to building scalable, data-heavy
frontend applications using **React and Next.js**.

## Highlights
- App Router with shared layouts
- Client-side rendering for authenticated dashboards
- Server-state management using React Query
- Pagination and caching for large datasets
- Performance optimization using memoization and lazy loading
- Authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)
